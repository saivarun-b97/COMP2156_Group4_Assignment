DevOps is a modern approach that combines software development and IT operations 
to improve teamwork and efficiency. Its main goal is to help organizations
deliver software faster while maintaining high quality and reliability.

One of the biggest benefits of DevOps is automation. 
By automating testing and deployment, teams can reduce human errors and save time.
This allows companies to release updates more frequently and respond quickly to user needs.
