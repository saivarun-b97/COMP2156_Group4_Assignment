Learning DevOps is extremely important in the software development life cycle (SDLC) because it helps bridge the gap between software development and system operations. DevOps practices enable faster development, continuous testing, and reliable deployment, reducing errors and improving software quality.

By integrating automation and continuous feedback into the SDLC, DevOps allows teams to detect issues early and respond quickly to changes. Understanding DevOps helps software engineers deliver applications more efficiently, maintain system stability, and meet business needs in today’s fast-paced technology-driven world.
By integrating DevOps into the SDLC, organizations can achieve higher software quality, faster release cycles, and improved system reliability. DevOps also supports scalability and adaptability, allowing software systems to evolve alongside changing user and business requirements.
