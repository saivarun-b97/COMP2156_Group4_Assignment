Importance of DevOps in SDLC 

DevOps is critical in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it promotes collaboration, automation, and faster feedback loops. By integrating DevOps, teams can automate testing and deployment, which reduces manual errors and ensures more frequent, reliable releases. This culture of continuous improvement allows organizations to respond to customer needs faster while maintaining system stability and security.
