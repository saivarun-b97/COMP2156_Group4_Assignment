SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process 
used to design, develop, test, and deliver software efficiently. 
It helps teams stay organized by breaking projects into clear stages
such as planning, development, testing, and deployment.

DevOps enhances the SDLC by encouraging better communication 
between development and operations teams. With continuous integration and automated testing,
problems can be identified earlier, making the development process faster, better and more reliable.

Using DevOps within the SDLC allows organizations to deliver higher-quality software 
while adapting quickly to changes.
For students, understanding this approach is important 
because it reflects how modern technology teams build and maintain applications.
