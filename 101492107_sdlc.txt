SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process 
used to design, develop, test, and deliver software efficiently. 
It helps teams stay organized by breaking projects into clear stages
such as planning, development, testing, and deployment.

DevOps enhances the SDLC by encouraging better communication 
between development and operations teams. With continuous integration and automated testing,
 problems can be identified earlier, making the development process faster and more reliable.
